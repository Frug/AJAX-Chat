AJAX Chat Standalone
====================

This is the standalone version of Blueimp's AJAX Chat. If you are looking for a version to integrate with your forum, select a different branch.

AJAX stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML".
The AJAX Chat clients (the user browsers) use JavaScript to query the web server for updates.
Instead of delivering a complete HTML page only updated data is sent in XML format. 

By using JavaScript the chat page can be updated without having to reload the whole page.
